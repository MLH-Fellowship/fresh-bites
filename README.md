## Introduction

We are delighted to welcome you to our app [Fresh Bites](https://fresh-bites.tech)! Take your health and wellness into your own hands today!

### What is Fresh Bites

Fresh Bites is an app that we created to help people live their healthiest lives. Fresh Bites makes it easier to plan their diets and cook their meals by allowing people to buy individual foods and the ingredients of said foods. This allows people greater control over what people put in their bodies. 

### Why did we create Fresh Bites

We created Fresh Bites in order to allow people greater control over what people put into their bodies. Alot of times, we just don't know what we are putting into our bodies, especially when so many common foods list ingredients that are not even food items. So we wanted to make it easier for people to plan healthier meals and diets for themselves and their loved ones. Thus, Fresh Bites was born. 

## Getting Started

Below are some instructions on how to get started on Fresh Bites and begin living a healthier lifestyle.

### Confirmation Page

### Spoonacular API

We make use of the Spoonacular API, which gives us access to information on a ton of recipes for healthy and delicious foods, to power our app. 

### Deployed on AWS

We have deployed our app via the cloud, more specifically using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Below is what that looks like:

![AWS Instance Overview](/app/static/img/AWS-overview.png)
![AWS Instance Details](/app/static/img/AWS-details.png)

We set this up by attaching our AWS CentOS virtual machine to GitHub via GitHub Secrets. We entered the information necessary to make the connection between our AWS instance and our app, thus deploying our site to AWS.

## Planned Future Features 

Below are some features we plan on implementing in the future. 

### Water Tracker with Alert

In order to be our healthiest selves, we humans require at least 80 fl. oz of water every day. However, because of our busy lives, we often lose track of this and often fall short of our water requirement because of it. Thus, we intend to implement a water tracker so that you can count how much water you drink in a day. Additionally, we plan to add an alert system to remind you at specific times throughout the day to drink a cup of water, making it easier to track and successfully attain the necessary water intake for you.

## A Bit about the Code

Below is some information about what we used to create this app, which will aid anyone looking to contribute to this project or otherwise interested in what we did here. 

### Technologies Used

On the Backend, we used Python with Flask to implement the logic of how each of our features work. We store the data using MySQL, which is a type of SQL Database. 

On the Frontend, we have implemented HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 

Additionally, we have implemented:
 - CI/CD using GitHub Actions 
 - Nginx
 - SSL Certification for additional security (HTTPS)
 - Monitoring using Graphana 
 - AUTH0 for Login/Signup
 - Docker to containerize different parts of the app (app, Nginx/SSL Certification, MySQL Database)

### Things to Note for Potential Contributors

In order to be able to test your additions locally, you have to install Flask and other necessary python packages. Those packages are specified in requirements.txt, the basic steps for Flask are shown below (for installing packages, recycle Step 3):

- Step 1: python3 -m venv venv
- Step 2: . venv/bin/activate
- Step 3: pip3 install Flask
- Step 4: export FLASK_ENV=development
- Step 5: flask run
